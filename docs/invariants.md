# Repository invariants

These rules record the operator-approved [September 11 design](superpowers/specs/2026-09-11-merge-lane-operator-invariants-design.md)
and September 10 mechanism audit. The audit found repeated manual recovery and
mechanisms interacting to stop progress. Of the last 40 merged PRs, every PR
was force-pushed, 27 received review-bot threads, and each fix or rebase repeated
a 22-minute Verify job; median open-to-merge time was 2.7 hours.

Run `make check` (or `make check-invariants` for the invariant subset). The
existing [runner](../tools/invariantcheck/main.go) executes exact tests listed in
[the manifest](../invariants/policy.json), rejecting missing, skipped, or failed
test evidence. These are repository-local checks, not a server-side trust
boundary. An invariant or enforcement change requires an edit to its entry here
in the same PR, an explanation of the effect, and its ID in “Invariants touched.”
A passing test does not authorize weakening a rule.

## INV-1 — Lane ownership

**Statement:** The orchestrator is the only writer of tracker lane state.

**Why:** Worker lane writes and lane revocation competed with the orchestrator's
state accounting, requiring operator repairs after apparently valid moves.

**Enforcement:** `TestRepositorySources` uses `go/packages` type information to
reject tracker lane method references, including saved method values, outside
`internal/orchestrator/lane_ledger.go` and the enumerated connector adapter files.
The ledger owns both `UpdateIssueState` and state-field `SetIssueField` calls;
adapters implement/forward these operations rather than decide transitions.
Admission requires its injected orchestrator writer, verified by
`TestAdmissionRequiresLedgerWriter`. Worker outcomes belong in Workpad status.
This source check cannot recognize arbitrary raw HTTP tracker writes; review
must reject those bypasses too.

**Change:** Edit INV-1 in this PR before changing the ownership boundary or its
adapter exceptions; do not expand an exception to admit another lane owner.

## INV-2 — Instance-owned infrastructure failures

**Statement:** Infrastructure failures attach to the instance, never to the issue, whether they happen before the first agent turn or during a turn.

**Why:** Backend startup, protocol, and workspace-hook failures previously parked
innocent issues and left the operator to return them to work.

**Enforcement:** `TestPreTurnFailuresDrainInstance` and
`TestObservedLanePreTurnFailureRemainsInstanceOwned` exercise instance attribution
and preserve issue ownership even after an observed lane change.
`TestIssueSpendSinceExcludesInstanceInfrastructureAttempts` excludes established
workspace, backend-startup, deliverable-authorization, forge, and tracker failure
classes from issue progress spend. `TestAgentRunProgressClassifiesPullRequestApprovalDecline`
and `TestApprovalDeniedDeliverableUsesInstanceForgeWait` preserve the connector
approval-denial classification through the existing instance-owned forge wait, while
`TestHandleRunResultReconcilesDeliverableRecoveryExactHead` preserves credential-failure
reconciliation. `TestWorkerCredentialBlockerError` preserves final-message credential
reports as write-path failures, and `TestCredentialForgeProbeRequiresSuccessfulWrite`
keeps the named project pause active until its write canary succeeds.
`TestCredentialWaitSurvivesOverlappingFailures` preserves credential precedence
when same-host failures overlap. `TestCredentialCanaryRecoversOverlappingHosts`
keeps one project credential canary admissible across overlapping host pauses,
including operator retries; the project remains paused while retained credential
conditions await a successful write canary.
`TestCredentialCanaryReplacementOverlappingHosts` preserves the same single-canary
admission when a condition needs a replacement issue.
`TestCredentialCanaryCrossHostFailureReleasesReservation` releases completed
canary ownership even when an error names another host, including terminal issues.
`TestCredentialCanaryDurableRecovery` preserves
inconclusive probes as durable waits and records successful write proof so restart
recovery cannot resurrect a resolved pause.
`TestCredentialConditionOutlivesOriginatingIssue` separates project health from
issue eligibility, and `TestCredentialClearSchedulesCanaryWithoutUnpausing`
consolidates the operator clear action onto that same write canary.
`TestObservedLaneCredentialCanaryCompletion` preserves instance recovery when
a canary observes a lane transition. When a condition outlives its original
issue, the existing dispatch reservation selects one replacement canary.
`TestRecoverBlockedIssuesFoldsLegacyCredentialParkIntoProjectPause` preserves migrated
credential waits across restart even after they leave the bounded general history window.
These execute through the invariant manifest. Runtime evidence is needed
to classify a new failure correctly; do not infer issue fault merely from a failed attempt.

**Change:** Edit INV-2 and its regression scenarios together in the same PR when
changing the first-turn boundary, in-turn infrastructure classification, or attribution.

Codex preflight scratch cleanup errors take precedence over simultaneous model
selection errors in implementation, validator, and security-audit launches
(#2561). The preceding selection error remains in logs rather than the returned
error chain or message, so typed and textual issue-configuration classification
cannot attribute an infrastructure cleanup failure to an issue.
`TestPreflightCleanupFailurePrecedence` exercises actual cleanup failure and
successful-cleanup controls for all three launch paths. This consolidates their
existing error handling without introducing a new failure class or recovery path.

Pre-dispatch provider capacity selection does not launch agent commands before an
attempt workspace exists (#2561). It shares configured model selection with the
worker and uses the existing provider report for availability. Attempt catalog
validation uses the reservation's advertised model scope, preserving automatic
fallback and legacy override rejection without changing the exact execution
reservation check. Reports advertise canonical backend model names; a stale
report cannot authorize a different runtime model. Catalog and effort validation
still run in the prepared workspace, where startup failures have attempt context.

## INV-3 — Mechanism moratorium

**Statement:** No new brake, breaker, lease, park, revocation, reason code, or reconciliation loop is allowed, unconditionally; any change to one must remove or consolidate an existing one, and the remedy is never a guard.

**Why:** The September 10 audit identified interactions among self-protection
mechanisms as the main source of incidents; adding another conditional guard
perpetuates that failure mode.

Worker GitHub credential unavailability and connector write-policy denials reuse
the forge-availability pause and write canary (#2548). They do not park an issue or
create a human prerequisite, and the named project condition clears after a
successful write proves recovery.

**Enforcement:** `TestRepositorySources` checks constant lane-transition reasons
against [the existing vocabulary](../internal/invariants/source_policy.json).
Unknown constants, including concatenations, fail. Existing dynamic forwarding
functions have reviewed, formatted-source SHA-256 entries: a new dynamic call
or a changed forwarding function fails until explicitly reviewed. This
conservative check also flags unrelated edits to those functions. It does not
prove the vocabulary of arbitrary upstream data: provider removal messages,
operator reasons, and existing decision helpers remain review boundaries.
Review must verify removal or consolidation; renaming a mechanism or updating
a snapshot is not evidence of compliance.

GitHub dependency hydration uses native relations as the source of truth when
available, removing the union with prose dependencies (#2575). Unsupported
repositories fall back to issue-body lines; historical comments are diagnostic
only. Public reads select the dependency source before resolving blockers, and
tracker refreshes replace authoritative empty lists instead of restoring prior
refs. This also removes the orchestrator's historical-comment union and prevents
reparsing connector-owned dependencies. Degraded native reads propagate errors
instead of certifying prose fallback or suppressing subsequent native reads.
Ignored prose and structured workpad dependency predicates absent from the native
list are explained without introducing another blocking mechanism. Native-backed
dispatch uses the current relation list instead of the terminal attempt's saved
dependency-deferral metadata; past attempts cannot restore a removed relation.
Removed structured dependencies remain cleared evidence for the existing blocked
recovery transition. Legacy workpad dependency sections and phrases are not
reinterpreted as human actions on native repositories; explicit human-action
sections and non-dependency predicates retain their existing meaning.

Validator launch accounting uses the existing validator-run registry and shared
worker progress publisher. Validators appear alongside implementation workers in
runtime snapshots, including during startup and completion, and leave the registry
on exit. This consolidates observability with existing lifecycle ownership; it adds
no recovery path or orphan-suppression guard (#2505).

**Change:** Edit INV-3 in the same PR with the removed/consolidated mechanism and
why the final change complies. Review reason sources before changing the
allowlist or a dynamic-function digest; never refresh these blindly to pass CI.

Issue #2567 explicitly authorizes the read-only `lane_signal_ignored` explanation
reason as a narrow exception to the reason-code moratorium. It reports ignored
tracker inputs through the existing explanation, board health, and doctor
surfaces. It does not enter the lane-transition vocabulary or affect dispatch,
recovery, or tracker writes; the lane-transition allowlist is unchanged. This
exception does not authorize any other reason code or lane mechanism.

Lifetime-limit parks remove the cooldown timer, timed recovery transition, and
signature permit (#2486). The vocabulary consolidates onto the existing
`lifetime_limit_recovered` reason, emitted only when an override is present or
the configured limits no longer apply. Elapsed time cannot release the park.

Todo dispatch resolves non-terminal dependency refs through the existing dependency
auto-unblock resolver and readiness predicate, sharing blocker reads within each
dispatch refresh (#2509). Closed tracker state releases ordinary dependencies
without requiring a terminal lane observation; human completion evidence remains
required. This consolidates dependency readiness without adding a recovery loop.

An explicit operator acknowledgement resets that issue's dispatch-loop history at
the acknowledgement timestamp (#2517). Kanban moves out of Blocked and `detent issue
--acknowledge-parks` share the existing recovery-park acknowledgement path, including
when the CLI acknowledgement leaves the issue in Blocked; automatic unparks and
unrelated issue history remain untouched. This consolidates operator retry intent
instead of adding another breaker or recovery loop.

Scheduled routine occurrences advance from their durable `scheduled_for` identity
regardless of success or failure. A selected occurrence whose existing ownership
context is already canceled is consumed without starting an agent. This removes the
implicit same-slot retry and relies on the existing schedule-ownership context rather
than adding a retry, backoff, or lease mechanism (#2526).

Backlog admission selection uses the existing run issue records for evaluation
identity, fingerprints, and stale verdicts. Unchanged stale candidates join the
existing epic and malformed-result exclusions before the window is capped;
remaining candidates rotate by last evaluation time. This replaces the fixed
evaluation window with selection from run/skip bookkeeping, without a
new routine, reason code, or suppression table (#2568).
Saved stale verdicts and new evaluations share the same point-lookup revalidation;
a candidate returning to its original eligible snapshot can re-enter the window.
This removes unconditional historical suppression across eligibility cycles.

Deliverable recovery opens a draft pull request when a worker already pushed an
exact-head branch but failed before creating the PR, and returns a missing remote
branch to Rework (#2528). This retires the human-owned no-PR park by consolidating
the repair into the existing deliverable-recovery and operator-routine paths.

Successful persisted attempts release dispatch ownership through the same completed
attempt cleanup even when completion-time pull-request hydration is unavailable
(#2553). Completion evidence and the existing hydration gate remain authoritative;
the claim no longer acts as an implicit park while no worker is running, and cleanup
is limited to the retained attempt claim so it cannot erase replacement ownership.

GitHub REST reserve and lookup decisions use credential-and-endpoint-family
snapshots instead of the last response labeled `core`. Ambiguous orchestrator
aggregate telemetry no longer creates the fleet-wide REST capacity outage;
explicit provider backoffs and worker/shared-pool reserve evidence retain their
existing handling (#2547). This consolidates the blanket dispatch pause into the
request-family gates that own the observed budget window.

Darwin process-environment inspection uses the existing workspace scan stage
budget instead of a separate per-process transient-read deadline (#2573).
Reconciliation and reaping both receive that stage budget; EINVAL/EIO retries do
not renew it, and expiration preserves the ownership error and verified partial
results. This removes a competing timer without adding a recovery mechanism.

## INV-4 — Native merge queue

**Statement:** Merges go through the repository's merge queue when one exists.

**Why:** Competing speculative merge work and repeated head invalidations
contributed to the measured rebase and CI loop.

**Enforcement:** `TestDelegateNativeMergeQueueIssuesEnqueuesGreenTrainWithoutWorkerDispatch`
exercises native queue delegation. `TestRepositoryWorkflow` requires
`merge_group: checks_requested` in this repository. Other repositories retain
their chosen settings; Detent detects the queue and uses its serialized merge
worker where no queue exists. These tests do not inspect live GitHub settings.

`detent doctor` reports runtime evidence: with a queue present, any
`merge_worker_programmatic_merge` lane event or `programmatic_merge_failed`
attempt in the last 24 hours fails the check. The store records no queue
activation time, so a merge from before a queue was enabled can fail the
check until it ages out of that day; a second queue removal routing to Human
Review is the budget, not a bypass.

**Change:** Edit INV-4 and the queue delegation tests in the same PR before
changing the ownership or fallback behavior.

## INV-5 — CI once per ready head

**Statement:** Real CI never runs on pull_request events. Pull requests carry only instant placeholder checks so the merge queue can accept them; the merge group runs the full suite once per batch and main runs the integration jobs after merge.

**Why:** Every reviewed PR was force-pushed and each fix/rebase repeated the long
Verify job; draft iteration avoids paying this cost before local review ends.

**Enforcement:** `TestRepositoryWorkflow` parses this repository's CI YAML,
requires the PR activity allowlist and draft exclusion on every PR job (including
the Invariant Gate), and restricts portability, Windows core, installer, and
snapshot jobs to main push or explicit manual dispatch. The manual dispatch is
a deliberate operator exception, not an automatic PR/merge-group trigger.
The worker convention is to finish local validation/review before marking ready;
Rework can produce a new ready head. Workflow assertions cannot deduplicate
manual reruns or repeated ready/reopened events. Other projects may opt into
label gating or their own CI convention.

`detent doctor` also reads every workflow under the project's source root and
warns when a job runs on pull_request events: a job is exempt only when its
`if` contains `github.event_name != 'pull_request'`, is exactly the placeholder
equality, or is made of `||` alternatives that each require some other
`github.event_name`. Projects may keep per-push CI; the verdict is a warning.

**Change:** Edit INV-5 and workflow assertions in the same PR when changing these
triggers, draft handling, or the documented manual-run exception.

## INV-6 — Isolated Codex home

**Statement:** Workers run with an isolated Codex home; user-level instructions never reach a worker.

**Why:** Host-level instructions introduced competing worker prerequisites and
operator interventions unrelated to the assigned repository task.

**Enforcement:** `TestPrepareCodexCommandForServiceIsolatesInstructions` and
`TestPrepareWorkerCodexHomeExistingInstructions` exercise service profile
isolation, per-worker SQLite state, and rejection of inherited instructions. The
manifest runs both.
Repository instructions and the Detent-provided worktree remain authoritative.

**Change:** Edit INV-6 and isolation tests together in the same PR before changing
home construction or instruction inheritance.

## INV-7 — Machine issue identity

**Statement:** Machine-filed issues carry an origin block and a fingerprint, and duplicates comment instead of creating another issue.

**Why:** Repeated repairs and machine discoveries otherwise create duplicate
work and obscure whether an issue came from an operator or automation.

**Enforcement:** `TestMachineIssueTool` exercises the worker tool and intake
contract through the manifest; `TestMachineIssueDuplicate`,
`TestMachineIssueSeparateConnectors`, and `TestMachineOriginSurvivesBodyUpdates`
exercise duplicate commenting, concurrent publishers, and durable origin stamping. Use `file_machine_issue`, with a stable problem key,
for worker discoveries. Review must ensure a fingerprint describes the problem
rather than a timestamp, attempt, or wording variation.

**Change:** Edit INV-7 and origin/deduplication scenarios in the same PR before
changing identity format or duplicate handling.

## INV-8 — No strict freshness protection

**Statement:** No strict up-to-date branch protection is allowed on branches Detent merges into.

**Why:** Strict freshness invalidated already-tested heads after other merges
and fed the measured repeated rebase/CI loop.

**Enforcement:** The existing merge-queue doctor recommendation reads protection
and measured history (`TestDoctorMergeQueueRecordedHistory`). Repository tests
cannot guarantee live branch settings, and this PR does not change them or add
a live doctor check per ID. The operator must inspect configured merged-into
branches; do not claim this rule is universally enforced by local CI.

**Change:** Edit INV-8 in the same PR with the intended protection semantics and
live verification plan; code changes never imply permission to edit settings.

## INV-9 — Retired mechanisms

**Statement:** Retired lane revocation, indeterminate-lane stops, per-issue infrastructure parking, and root-level `rateLimit` in mutation documents stay retired.

**Why:** The audit removed these paths because they stopped healthy progress or
caused tracker protocol failures that the operator then had to repair.

**Enforcement:** `TestRepositorySources` rejects retired identifiers and constant
strings, including assembled constants; it tokenizes GraphQL strings to reject
`rateLimit` in mutation documents, including aliases and fragments. Obtain budget
information with a separate query. Comments and string-valued GraphQL arguments
are ignored. INV-2's behavioral tests cover infrastructure attribution. Negative
fixtures demonstrate forbidden behavior fails. Documentation and test fixtures
may name retired mechanisms; runtime code may not restore them. Novel names,
reflection, generated runtime documents, and semantic equivalents require review.

**Change:** Edit INV-9 and the corresponding negative/behavioral tests in the same
PR before changing retired-symbol or mutation rules; removal from a list alone
is not an authorized resurrection.

## Check boundaries

The source walk covers non-test Go packages under `internal`, `cmd`, and `tools`
for the build platform running the gate. CI's Linux, macOS, and Windows test
jobs cover their selected files. It deliberately leaves docs and negative test
fixtures available to explain violations. Source vocabulary and workflow checks
complement behavioral tests; they do not prove every natural-language rule,
protect themselves against edits, or enforce live settings. See the
[runner contract](../invariants/README.md) for the same limitations.
